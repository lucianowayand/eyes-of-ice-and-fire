# Eyes of Ice and Fire

### Description
Took me some time to discover that there were bigger dragons lurking in the depths, and now that I found that out I'm crazy about them! Sadly there wasn't an easy way to find those dragons, now there is! This mod adds items similar to eyes of ender that help you locate nearby dragons from the Ice and Fire mod.

This is not the same mod as Eye of Dragons but it is my attempt to bring it to the most recent version of Minecraft.

### Requirements
* Ice and Fire
* Citadel

### Crafting
The eyes are crafted by combining an Ender Pearl with a bottle of dragon blood. The used blood vial will determine what kind of dragon the eyes will seek. It searches for entities inside your render distance and it may not find any dragons around depending on how far you are from one and your render distance size. As with the vanilla eyes of ender, it may break, so make sure to bring more than one on your adventures!

### Installation
Ensure you have installed Minecraft Forge for the appropriate Minecraft version.
Download and install the Ice and Fire mod.
Download and install Citadel.
Place the Dragon Seeker mod .jar file in your Minecraft mods folder.

### Usage
Equip the eye in your inventory.
Right-click to use the eye and it will guide you towards the nearest dragon of the corresponding type within your render distance.
Keep in mind, the eye may break upon use, so bring extras!
